# King of the Dice

## The App

"King of the Dice" is the ultimate gambling game where you can hit a jackpot of 100 euros in just one roll! The only thing you need to do is just throw 4 sixes to become a winner. 

By default you play with at least 4 dice. But you can increase your stake to 6 dice! Buy-in is only one euro per dice. Do you think this is too expensive? Do not hesitate! Because when the total of the top of your dice is higher than the bottom of your roll, you get the turn for free!
